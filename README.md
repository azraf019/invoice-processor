# InvoiceAI Processor: Intelligent Invoice Data Extraction

InvoiceAI Processor is a powerful, full-stack web application designed to automate the extraction of data from PDF invoices. Using Google's Gemini AI, it intelligently parses single or multiple PDF documents, extracts key information, and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface. Users can then review, edit, and export the data to an Excel spreadsheet, streamlining accounting and data entry workflows.
